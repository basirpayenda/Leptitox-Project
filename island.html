<div class="readers-version"><p><span class="highlightOp">She exercises every morning</span>…</p>
    <p>Jogging, pushups, squats.</p>
    <div style="float:left;width:50%;padding:10px;"><img src="/i7/image001.jpg"></div>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">She eats a healthy breakfast</span>…</p>
    <p>Oats, eggs, spinach</p>
    <p>And dinner… Chicken, broccoli, rice</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">She diets</span>… Keto, Vegan, Paleo.</p>
    <p><strong>Just as the doctor ordered.</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">She’s <strong>tired</strong>… She <strong>aches</strong>… She’s <strong>hungry</strong>…</span></p>
    <p>Exhausted, she sleeps.</p>
    <p>But every morning, the scales never change.</p>
    <p>She tries to ignore it, but for my wife Grace</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;">She is a prisoner of her belly fat.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">A 46-year-old mother of three</span>, trapped inside her own body…</p>
    <p>Her shoulders slumped, as the realization set in…</p>
    <p>She was going to be overweight for the rest of her life.</p>
    <p>Grace looked up at me, and in tears she uttered 5 words I don’t think I’ll ever forget… </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style=" color:red;">“I can’t live like this”, she said.</span></p>
    <p>I’ve never felt so helpless in all my life.</p>
    <p>I was angry at the doctors whose diets and exercise has done nothing…</p>
    <p>Angry at God for letting this happen to the woman I loved.</p>
    <p>Angry at myself for not being able to do anything to help.</p>
    <p>But I couldn’t. I didn’t know how.</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">So why am I sharing this story with you today?</span></p>
    <p>What happened next is very painful for me to tell...</p>
    <p>But it forced me to go on a journey that changed everything in my life, and the life of tens of thousands of women and men around the world…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;">That led to my discovery of a 5 Second “Water Hack” from a tiny Malaysian island</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image002.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"></p>
    <p>One so powerful it would completely transform my 46-year-old wife’s life…</p>
    <p>Support a healthy heart, arteries, and blood sugar levels…</p>
    <p>And after years of failed diets and feeling hopeless – melt away 2lbs overnight, and in just a matter of weeks….</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;">Lose 62lbs of raw ugly fat</span><span style=" color:red;"> from all over her belly, arms, face, hips and thighs…</span></p>
    <p>Going from this… &nbsp;&nbsp;to this…</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image003.jpg"><img src="/i7/image004.jpg"></p>
    <p>Relieving her of the debilitating feelings of stress, anxiety and depression that were ruining her health… </p>
    <p>while restoring the energy, hope, sex drive, and zest for life that she thought she would never enjoy again.</p>
    <p>Leaving her doctor speechless, and every overweight woman and man desperate to know her secret.</p>
    <p>You see, despite what you’ve been told</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;">the REAL CAUSE of your increasing belly and body fat <span class="highlightOp">has NOTHING to do with</span>:</span></p>
    <ul>
    <li>How much you diet, starve yourself, or deprive yourself of your favorite foods…</li>
    <li>How much grueling exercise you do…</li>
    <li>How much sugar or carbohydrates you eat…</li>
    <li>Your thyroid, hormones or metabolism…</li>
    <li>Or even genetics or the aging process…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s what they want you to believe. That you’re broken. That it is your fault. <span style="color:red;"><strong>But it’s not your fault.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Instead it’s all down to this:</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image005.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">A dangerous foreign compound swimming in your blood stream right now.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;">That is forcing your body to store more and more fat….</span></p>
    <p>That scientists have found is abundant in every woman and man - especially those over 40 years of age - who are finding it impossible to lose and keep fat off their body</p>
    <p>And according to new ground-breaking research by a team at Stirling University, Scotland, is the REAL root-cause of why we gain weight, and America’s obesity crisis.</p>
    <p> But fear not, by using my discovery of <span class="highlightOp">this simple forbidden <span style="color:red;"><strong>5-Second Water Hack</strong></span>- which I’m about to reveal on this short page</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image006.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">known <strong>only to the inhabitants</strong> of a small, barely populated Malaysian island, 8900 miles from home…</span></p>
    <p>You can quickly target this dangerous foreign compound…</p>
    <p>And <span style="color:red;"><strong>stop</strong> your body from storing excess weight.</span></p>
    <p>A truth hidden by the weight loss industry whose entire business relies on you NEVER losing a single pound.</p>
    <p>And yes, this discovery has nothing to do with ab crunches, fasting, counting calories, dieting, or even gastric bypass surgery and extreme cardio routines like CrossFit, P90X or Insanity.</p>
    <p>Instead it’s just this simple Malaysian 5-Second Water Hack once a day.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Grace still ate all her favorite foods like brownies, pizza, cheesecake, and ice cream.</span> </p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image007.jpg"></p>
    <p>In fact, eating these foods <span style="color:red;"><strong>is recommended</strong>!</span></p>
    <p>This 100% safe and natural 5-second ritual that turned my wife’s life around and gave her back her lean, sexy and stress-free body — is something too important to hide…</p>
    <p>And until now that’s been the problem. This simple hack has been right under our noses and been kept from us by the folks we trust to make us better…</p>
    <p>But not any more…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;">Because in the next 3 and a half minutes I’m going to share with you why everything you thought you knew about belly fat and how to lose it, <span class="highlightOp">is flat out wrong.</span></span></p>

    <p> You are going to be filled with disgust when you hear a weight loss industry insider break his code of silence and reveal the 3 biggest weight loss LIES touted by doctors and “fitness experts” around the world…</p>
    <p>… and the real reason why every diet or exercise plan you do, may work for a bit, but will always fail…</p>

    <p>Plus, all the peer-reviewed studies that prove how this works…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>The truth is, you and your doctor simply do not know about this simple, all natural and unconventional breakthrough…</strong></span></p>
    <p>It is so effective that it’s already worked for <span class="highlightOp">over 166,304 people – and this number is steadily increasing…</span></p>
    <p>I even used this hack myself and lost 28lbs, I can fit into my 32-inch jeans for the first time in 11 years and I can see my abs again. I feel incredible.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">And just as I can promise the sun will rise tomorrow morning, <span class="highlightOp">so can I promise this will work for you too...</span></span></p>

    <p>because I promise you – you can melt away pounds of stubborn fat with nothing more than this glass of water and <span style=" color:red;"><strong>my bizarre once a day 5-second Water Hack.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Yes, it really is that easy.</p>
    <p>It’s time I introduced myself properly…</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image010.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Hello, my name is Morgan Hurst.</strong></span></p>
    <p> I’m no doctor. I’m no nutritionist. I’m no guest lecturer at Yale University. You know what I am? I’m you. A real person. </p>
    <p>I’m a 47-year-old firefighter and I live with my wife Grace and our 3 kids in Denver, Colorado.</p>
    <p>I’ve protected my community, their homes and their lives for over a decade. I helped lead the efforts in the Spring Creek Fire of 2018 and Wolf Creek Pass fire of 2013. </p>
    <p>But I know what it feels like to lose control.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>The same way a fire can turn on you any moment. <span style="color:red;">Your body can too. </span></strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">And that’s what happened to Grace.</span> </p>
    <p>Grace’s story is one that is very personal and embarrassing, but will be familiar to you.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">It started about 15 years ago when she became pregnant with our first child, Darrel.</span> </p>
    <p>We were your average happily married thirty-somethings, enjoying life, and like the majority of people, taking our health for granted pretty much every day.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">Grace had been an all-star track champion in her teens.</span></p>
    <p>An athlete her whole life…</p>
    <p>It was one of the things that made me fall in love with her…</p>
    <p>But during Darrel’s pregnancy she put on about 30 pounds. Which never went away. Then our next child, Kirsty came along, and on went another 20 pounds. After our third child, she was already 70 pounds heavier.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image003.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">Every time she looked down, grabbing her belly I could see her feel <strong>shame and guilt</strong> for letting herself go like this and not doing anything about it.</span></p>
    <p>She went to see Doctor Mathews who was very concerned about Grace’s health and warned us we needed to do something before her health deteriorated even more… or worse.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">So surprise-surprise, he recommended a calorie-controlled diet and exercise</span>, and although we didn’t realize it at the time, this moment would mark the <strong>beginning of a 10-year nightmare</strong>.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">Because after the hope and enthusiasm with every new diet, <span style="color:red;"><strong>came the crushing disappointment when it would inevitably fail</strong></span>, and the weight came back plus a little more.</span></p>
    <p>I mean Grace tried everything to lose the stubborn fat: vegetarian, low carb, keto, paleo, fasting, special teas, even hypnosis.</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image011.jpg" width="500"></p>
    <p>We spent thousands on meal plan deliveries, home gym equipment, gym memberships, ab crunchers, and not to mention the fitness classes like CrossFit, Zumba, Insanity, P90X and more.</p>
    <p>And I'm not going to tell you that these strategies didn't work. They did work for a while, but like so many people, <span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;"><strong>Grace couldn't stick to any of them</strong>.</span></p>
    <p>And every time Grace felt upset or bad, she turned to comfort foods and the diet was over.</p>
    <p>As the years rolled by, Grace’s energy levels, vitality, mood and general health and wellbeing went rapidly downhill.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>You see, I know exactly what you are going through, the shame, the pants that don’t fit, the binging, the scale anxiety. </strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">I get it. </span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Because I saw Grace live these feelings every day.</span> </p>
    <p>But still we trusted the doctors and although Grace’s diets and exercise were supposed to help, she piled on more and more weight, as she found herself unable to fight the intense cravings for sugary and starchy foods that overpowered her every day.</p>
    <p>And the more weight she put on, the more depressed she became – <span style="color:red;"><strong>and the further away she drifted from the woman I’d fallen in love with.</strong></span></p>
    <p>On top of it all, our sex life had completely gone.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image012.jpg"></p>
    <p> We found ourselves slipping into a long, boring routine of going to work, watching TV and going to bed while feeling constantly tired, depressed, unhappy and dissatisfied.</p>
    <p>Until one night, with Grace asleep upstairs I found myself browsing Instagram, looking at slim, sexy women in their bikinis on beaches. <span class="highlightOp">I felt so guilty, but I couldn’t help myself.</span></p>
    <p>I wondered why I didn’t find Grace as sexy as these women. I wished to God I did, but I didn’t.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image013.jpg"></p>
    <p>I felt so bad that I turned off my iPad and went upstairs to show her how much I loved her no matter what she looked like…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">“Don’t touch me. I’m fat and disgusting and I’m always going to be fat and disgusting. <span style="color:red;">I don’t want you to touch me</span>”</span></p>
    <p>she yelled when I reached out to hold her… to kiss her… to show her I cared.</p>
    <p>Seeing her embarrassed, laying there grabbing her belly fat she hated so much… I felt powerless and weak in a way I never thought I could…</p>
    <p>That night I lay awake for hours next to Grace, staring at the ceiling and feeling my heart constrict in my chest… imagining life without my wife…</p>
    <p> I had vowed to take care of her.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image014.jpg"></p>
    <p>So, I made a promise to myself.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">I was going to do everything in my power to defeat her belly fat for good, whatever it took.</span></p>
    <p>I was going to fix her, I was going to make her love herself and her body again, and I was going to do it without diet or exercise.</p>
    <p>After all, the reason for most of her health problems over those 10 years had been because of the diets and exercises she’d been torturing herself with.</p>
    <p>Because that’s when her health really began to worsen.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">The thought of losing Grace too soon broke my heart. She was my rock.</span> </p>
    <p>So that night I got on my tablet when she’d fallen asleep, and began my mission.</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>I started my research with our fat cells.</strong></span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image015.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">You see when fat cells grow, they release a hormone called <strong>leptin</strong>.</span></p>
    <p>You may have already heard of <span style="color:red;">leptin.</span></p>
    <p>It controls our hunger, and how full we feel.</p>
    <p>When leptin levels are low, we feel hungry and crave calories.</p>
    <p>When leptin levels are high, we feel full and satisfied.</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image016.jpg" width="600"></p>
    <p>Sounds simple enough.</p>
    <p>But problems arise when something called <span class="highlightOp"><strong>leptin resistance happens.</strong></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;">Take a look at this image, I’m sure this cycle sound familiar.</span></p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image017.jpg" width="600"></p>
    <p>You eat your food, that’s at the top there.</p>
    <p>Excess energy from food is converted into fat and stored in our fat cells.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">As fat cells expand, they release leptin, signaling your body to stop eating.</span> </p>
    <p>It is here when naturally you should stop eating and feel full and satisfied… put the knife and fork down and maintain a slim, sexy figure.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>But instead <span class="highlightOp">leptin resistance</span> occurs.</strong></span></p>
    <p>As your body is resisting leptin signals, the brain never gets the message you’re full.</p>
    <p>Instead you continue to feel hungrier and hungrier, even though you are eating more and more.</p>
    <p>Until at the end, you’ve eaten that entire cake, you’ve wolfed down that whole bag of chips, you feel guilty, you feel sick, you feel tired. But you still don’t feel entirely full or satisfied.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>You’ve gone from feeling hungry to feeling sick and tired!</strong></span></p>
    <p>And a short time later, the cycle starts all over again!</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">This is the exact cycle that Grace had been in for years…</span></p>
    <p>And the same cycle, you and any other woman or man struggling with weight loss are in right now. That’s a scientific fact.</p>
    <p>You see it’s not your fault you took just one, two, or three more slices of pizza, or decided to finish off that tray of cookies… you don’t lack willpower… it’s all down to your inability to turn off your hunger.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>But what causes leptin resistance?</strong></span></p>
    <p>Well, I couldn’t find a single precise and definitive answer on exactly WHY it happens in the first place.</p>
    <p> And why this has started only in the past 50 years.</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image018.jpg" width="600"></p>
    <p> Look at this graph, <span class="highlightOp">overweight people barely existed in the 1950s.</span></p>
    <p>Doctor Mathews himself stated that the medical industry isn’t exactly sure where leptin resistance comes from, only why it is bad for us and that it is increasing at a rapid rate.</p>
    <p>A recent report published by the OECD, based in Paris, France <span class="highlightOp">predicts that 75% of all American adults will be obese and leptin resistant by 2020 if things don’t change.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">You may be thinking that it’s because we’re eating more, right?</span></p>
    <p>Well remember that cycle of leptin resistance…</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image017.jpg" width="400"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>Leptin resistance CAUSES overeating<br>
    and therefore more fat – not the other way around!</strong></span> </p>
    <p>So, if your overeating was simply <span style="color:red;">a symptom of leptin resistance. What was the cause?</span></p>
    <p>How did you or Grace get leptin resistance, before all the weight gain began?</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">For weeks, I devoured everything the library had to offer</span>, I read through hundreds of dusty old medical journals. I visited Universities, spoke to doctors, endocrinologists, alternative therapists, and even Chinese herb doctors for help.</p>
    <p>But I found nothing new.</p>
    <p>Just the same old tired advice of eat less, exercise more, and count calories.</p>
    <p>… Advice that you or any other person struggling with weight loss listening to my story today has heard a million times before.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">I felt like I’d hit a brick wall, and after weeks of research I was nowhere.</span> </p>
    <p>Until I’d left online posts on forums and message boards requesting any information that could help Grace.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image022.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style=" color:red;"><strong>I spoke with a man I’ll call Jonah, who has asked to remain anonymous to protect his identity.</strong></span></p>
    <p>For 10 years Jonah had been working at America’s biggest weight loss brand with an annual revenue of over $1 billion – you know the kind that ship you those “healthy” meals, shakes and meal plans every month…</p>
    <p>Until he became sick of what the weight loss industry had become, and was fired for finally speaking up against his greedy CEO’s and voicing his concerns.</p>
    <p>Over our call, he revealed to me the </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;"><strong>3 biggest and closely guarded LIES of the weight loss industry</strong></span></p>
    <p>And it was because, in his own words, the whole industry was “a giant and deliberate fraud”, which makes billions every year not by helping you lose weight, but by actively making you FATTER!</p>
    <p>As Jonah explained, the moment you feel your belly get a little squishy and your hips getting a bit wobblier, you’re encouraged to stop eating so much food, stop eating carbohydrates, and restrict your calories.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;">Sound familiar right?</span></p>
    <p>But the big problem here is that from this moment on, your waist size, and health is destined to only get <span class="highlightOp"><strong>WORSE</strong>, not better…</span></p>
    <p>After all, when was the last time you went on a diet, and perhaps lost some weight, and the weight stayed off forever?</p>
    <p>It’s never happened, right?</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">And this is the <span style="color:red;">Big Weight Loss Lie #1</span></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>Dieting Helps You Lose Weight</strong></span></p>

    <p>In a huge study carried out by researchers at the University of Helsinki of 2,452 women and 2,227 men, researchers found that among both women and men, irregular eating and a history of dieting in order to lose weight were two of the key factors that actually led to weight GAIN not weight loss.</p>
    <p>That’s because like our early ancestors, our bodies prevent weight loss following what they perceive to be a famine. When you diet your body thinks you are starving and protects itself by holding onto weight. And the more diets you do, you are training your body to hold onto more and more weight.</p>
    <p>Sure, you may lose a couple pounds but research shows <span style="color:red;"><strong>95% of all diets fail</strong>. And in fact, <span style="color:red;"><strong>over 66% of people who diet end up putting on more weight within months of starting.</strong></span></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Why? Because by dieting - not only are you training your body to hold onto fat</span> - but the root cause of your weight gain has not been addressed. You are still craving food.</p>
    <p>Worse still, dieting more than once is proven to cause an increased risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, loss of strength and thinning hair</p>
    <p>To really lose weight and keep it off for life - you have to go after the root-cause – leptin resistance - not just treat the symptoms and live as a slave to your overweight body.</p>
    <p><strong>That’s why diet shakes and exercise plans are such a cash-cow for the weight loss industry.</strong></p>
    <p>Because you are still trapped in the leptin resistance cycle! Weight loss companies make the most profit by having people completely stuck in the cycle for life. Trying fad after fad, diet after diet.</p>
    <p>It made complete sense. That’s exactly what Grace had been doing for years.</p>
    <p>And according to a recent survey the average American will spend over $111,500 in their attempt to lose weight over their lifetime.</p>
    <p>And that’s just ONE person…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">It’s big business and a business they will fight to protect.</span></p>
    <p>Because their business model will be destroyed if the world finds out that they can break free, and lose weight naturally without their useless diets and exercises.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Next Jonah revealed <span style="color:red;">Big Weight Loss Lie #2</span></span></p>
    <p>This one shocked me.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style=" color:red;">Exercise Helps You Lose Weight</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image024.jpg"></p>
    <p>Jonah said that when you exercise, inflammation occurs in your body. And inflammation increases your body’s production of the stress hormone <span style="color:red;">cortisol. And guess what? <span class="highlightOp">Cortisol, just like “starvation mode” from dieting, tells your body to hold onto fat!</span></span></p>
    <p>This would explain not only your inability to lose weight—as your body is constantly fighting fires inside of you—but it’s also why you can actually gain weight from exercising too much—because of all the compounding inflammation.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;">Plus, in a 2009 study, they found that people who exercised, actually increased their food intake, crushing their weight loss goals.</span></p>
    <p>In conclusion, there is no doubt exercise is healthy, but as a weight loss method it is not a long-term solution, <span class="highlightOp"><strong>it is simply treating the symptom of your leptin resistance, your belly fat</strong>, rather than addressing the root cause of your hunger.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">And with that, Jonah revealed the <span style="color:red;">Big Weight Loss Lie #3</span></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;">Slow Metabolism Causes Weight Gain</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image025.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>So, can a “sluggish metabolism” be blamed for weight gain?</strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Believe it or not, overweight people actually have a HIGHER metabolism than those of a healthy weight and this increases as more weight is added.</span> </p>
    <p>As someone gains more weight from storing more fat, the body needs to support that excess mass to carry it around. Imagine you had to live with a 45 lb. weight tied around your waist. You would struggle to deal with this for the first few weeks, but over time you would build up extra muscle – especially in your legs – to help manage it. More muscle equals a higher metabolic rate at rest.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, but Jonah was absolutely right.</strong></span></p>
    <p>So, if you thought that your lack of exercise caused your weight gain. If you thought that you didn’t diet enough, or you have a slow metabolism. Think again. <span style="color:red;"><strong>They had no factor in why you are overweight today.</strong></span></p>
    <p>They are not the true cause of leptin resistance.</p>
    <p>I know this because in just 1 minute I will reveal to you the REAL little-known cause of leptin resistance as proven by numerous clinical studies. &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image026.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">A dangerous foreign chemical, inside every person who struggles with weight loss</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">As well as the simple 5-second water trick you can do RIGHT NOW to target this toxin and STOP storing fat.</span></p>
    <p>The truth? Leptin resistance can be addressed. </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Your belly fat, arm fat, hip fat and thigh fat is REVERSIBLE. It is not a life sentence.</span></p>
    <p>You see after speaking to Jonah I kept wondering…</p>
    <p>If dieting and exercise had done nothing and never would do anything to help Grace’s overweight body, <span style="color:red;"><strong>then what could?</strong></span></p>
    <p>If the top 2 things that doctors and the entire weight loss industry had told us would help, did nothing for her belly fat, or tackle its root cause - leptin resistance - then what would?</p>
    <p>Sadly, Jonah didn’t have the answer.</p>
    <p>And I was close to giving up and that’s when I discovered something that chilled me to the bone…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">I’m embarrassed to share this with you, but I feel I have to…</span></p>
    <p>Using Grace’s laptop one night, I stumbled on some of her Google searches.</p>
    <p>“Best ways to kill yourself”, said one query.</p>
    <p>“Painless suicide”, said another.</p>
    <p>I had no idea Grace was feeling that low.</p>
    <p>I was desperate to help her, but didn’t know how.</p>
    <p>The future looked bleak…</p>
    <p>But that very night, I received a phone call that would change everything – not that I knew it at the time.</p>
    <p>I’ve always believed in God, and prayed to him practically every night for weeks, asking him to help Grace.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">And I firmly believe that what happened next is proof that he was listening.</span> </p>
    <p>The call came from my boss.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image027.jpg"></p>
    <p> I’d been asked to lead an educational project in Malaysia. In 2016 they suffered. nearly 3000 forest and bush fires and were looking to learn more about how we manage our forest fires in the US.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>They needed an experienced man as a project supervisor, and with my experience I was one of the top candidates.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Given Grace’s condition and state of mind, the timing couldn’t have been worse – or so I thought.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">But unable to do anything about it, I set off for Malaysia, leaving Grace’s sister in charge of her safety.</span></p>
    <p>I hated leaving her – but as it turned out, the men I would meet on that job would provide the answer to my prayers – and in the strangest of ways.</p>
    <p>Right after my grueling 42 hours of traveling, I’m introduced to the firefighters I would be training, a group of 22 men from all over Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Among them was Ashraff Hadi and 5 other guys who were from a tiny Malaysian island called Langkawi.</p>
    <p>As the weeks went on, I came to realize these 6 guys who were all in their mid-50s <span style="color:red;"><strong>didn’t have an ounce of fat on them, they were slim, healthy and full of energy.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Every dinner we spent together <span class="highlightOp">I would notice they would eat their plate of food, but then never eat again for rest of the day, <span style="color:red;"><strong>no second portions</strong></span>, no desserts, no snacks, even with the delicious plates of cakes, fried food and candy bars that were available.</span></p>
    <p>Back home I would never have seen it. We love our food and we keep eating and eating even after dinner.</p>
    <p>So that night, I took Ashraff to one side and asked him.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;"><strong>“How do you have the willpower to not eat all this amazing food?”</strong></span></p>
    <p>I told him all about my wife’s condition, her suicidal thoughts, and that I had nowhere else to turn…</p>
    <p>“If you know anything that can help her, please tell me”, I pleaded.</p>
    <p>Ashraff smiled, patted me on the shoulder, and told me to wait where I was.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image93.jpg"></p>
    <p> A few minutes later, he returned with a notepad and pencil, and began to scribble down what looked like a recipe, complete with a list of strange plants and herbs, most of which I’d never even heard of.</p>
    <p>“What’s this?” I asked him, looking down the list.</p>
    <p>“The secret you’ve been searching for” he said, with a glint in his eye.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">“Our health is all down to these ingredients”, he continued, mysteriously.</span></p>
    <p>“Obesity simply doesn’t exist on our island.”</p>
    <p>“This recipe has been in my family for generations”, he said. <span style="color:red;"><strong>“Eat these ingredients and your wife will be fine.”</strong></span> </p>
    <p>With that, Ashraff stood up, gave me a knowing smile, and got back to work.</p>
    <p>Only then did I remember that Ashraff and his friends had this small leather bag containing a powdered mix of plants and that they would take one spoonful every day.</p>
    <p>I had asked to try it, but they said it was more valuable than gold and politely refused!</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">The minute I returned home to the US; I began researching the ingredients from Ashraff’s recipe.</span> </p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image029.jpg"></p>
    <p>The first one was something called <span style="color:red;"><strong>marian thistle</strong>…</span></p>
    <p> &nbsp;“What the heck was that?” I thought.</p>
    <p>We actually know it as milk thistle here in the US.</p>
    <p>According to research, milk thistle has anti-aging effects and supports healthy cholesterol levels….</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">But more importantly it detoxifies BPA – a compound known as an <span style="color:red;"><strong>endocrine disrupting chemical or EDC.</strong></span></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">Now stay with me here, because this is where it gets VERY interesting.</span></p>
    <p>BPA is found all over the world, in cans of food, plastics, sports drinks and more.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image030.jpg"></p>
    <p>Scientists are only just beginning to understand why man-made chemicals like BPA are so harmful. It’s believed once you come into contact with them, they enter our blood stream and disrupt our delicate body functions.</p>
    <p>And I wasn’t sure what that had to do with belly fat until I began to search deeper…</p>
    <p>And struck gold.</p>
    <p>A study by a team at the Department of Neuroscience in Ontario, Canada less than 2 years ago, with barely a single view…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Found by giving mice low doses of BPA, far <span style="color:red;"><strong>lower than deemed safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</strong></span> – they became <span style="color:red;"><strong>resistant to leptin</strong></span>, their food intake was never suppressed, and they quickly put on weight.</span></p>
    <p>Incredible.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>But BPA is only one of many endocrine disrupting chemicals in our environment.</strong></span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image031.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>TBT is found in paint, pesticides, and vinyl products</strong></span>…and a new March 2019 study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology has directly linked it to leptin resistance too!</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-right"><img src="/i7/image032.jpg"></p>
    <p> What about <span style="color:red;"><strong>PFOA, an endocrine disrupter found in Teflon cookware</strong>, that soaks into your food as you cook? Well a study published in Molecular and cellular endocrinology linked PFOA to leptin resistance as well.</span></p>
    <p>In fact, recently the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, and White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity declared <span style="color:red;"><strong>“endocrine disrupting chemicals an immediate danger to America’s waistlines”</strong></span></p>
    <p>Since then - study after study, like those published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.</p>
    <p>Toxicological Sciences…</p>
    <p>Even Dr Oz.</p>
    <p>Have linked - without a doubt <span style=" color:red;"><strong>- endocrine disrupting chemicals to leptin resistance!</strong></span> </p>
    <p>We now know it’s not because of your diet or how much exercise you do.</p>
    <p>Nor your age.</p>
    <p>Nor genetics.</p>
    <p>Or metabolism.</p>
    <p>Your food cravings have been scientifically unstoppable because of the <span class="highlightOp"><strong>invisible EDCs swimming in your blood stream right now</strong>. Causing havoc in every cell on your body…</span></p>
    <p>Well what if we just move to another part of the US or even abroad to escape them?</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">But EDC’s are everywhere! In every country on earth. They are inescapable.</span> They are in the air we breathe, our fruits, our meats, our cereals, they are even in our tap water.</p>
    <p>In fact the USA has one of the highest levels of EDCs in tap water in the world, <span style="color:red;"><strong>with over 76 different EDCs detected. Scary.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Remember this graph?</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image018.jpg" width="400"></p>
    <p>We see obesity and leptin resistance started around the 1950’s.</p>
    <p>Now look at this graph of <span style="color:red;"><strong>EDC exposure over time</strong> by a team at Stirling University in Scotland.</span></p>
    <p>Look familiar?</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image033.jpg" width="600"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Notice the rapid incline at 1950 matches exactly when obesity spiraled out of control…</strong></span></p>
    <p>The researchers at Stirling University concluded that the level of EDCs in our bodies directly correlated with how overweight we were. <span style=" color:red;"><strong>And that EDCs were the real reason for America’s obesity epidemic.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Finally, it all made sense!</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Simply put, these foreign chemicals are entering your blood stream, and <span style="color:red;"><strong>disrupting your brain from detecting leptin</strong></span>, making you crave food more and more.</span></p>
    <p>And guess what… while the level of EDCs in Malaysia was one of the highest in the world, far higher than the US, I found out they actually had one of the LOWEST levels of overweight people!</p>
    <p>It must be because of these traditional plant ingredients they eat. It would explain why Ashraff and his guys, who even though they worked in Malaysia, in an extremely toxic environment, never overate, and didn’t have an ounce of fat on them.</p>
    <p>As I finished reading, I felt like I wanted to cry… not because I was sad, but because for the first time in YEARS I felt HOPE that I could actually help my wife… and help US get our life and our relationship back on track.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image035.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>But don’t go out and order a crate of milk thistle just yet…</strong></span></p>
    <p> You see next on Ashraff’s list of craving-crushers was <span style="color:red;"><strong>Apium graveolens seed</strong>, which is shown to <span class="highlightOp">detoxify the EDC called DEHP</span>, found in nearly all plastics!</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-right"><img src="/i7/image036.jpg"></p>
    <p>And then there was <span style="color:red;">jujube that <span class="highlightOp">detoxifies the endocrine disrupter, ZEA</span></span></p>
    <p>And <span style="color:red;">grape seed that <span class="highlightOp">cleanses the harmful EDC cadmium found in vegetables, nuts and cereals</span>. It even supports healthy blood pressure!</span></p>
    <p>Plus, a whole host of other plants like:</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">Alfalfa</span>, a detoxifying flowering plant that <span class="highlightOp">replenishes vitamins and heals the liver.</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image037.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">Chanca piedra</span>, full of antioxidants that <span class="highlightOp">detoxifies EDCs. supports healthy inflammation responses, healthy kidney function and digestive health.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">Taraxacum leaves</span>, high in vitamin K <span class="highlightOp">that protects bone health and cleanses the liver.</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image038.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">Brassicas </span> a type of broccoli, overflowing with cysteine, a nutrient needed to make glutathione, <span class="highlightOp">one of the body’s most important antioxidants.</span> </p>
    <p><span style="color:red;">Barberry</span>, a plant abundant with berberine, which not only prevents fat storage <span class="highlightOp">but supports healthy cholesterol levels and a healthy brain.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>In the end, Ashraff’s recipe included 11 natural ingredients clinically proven to detoxify the body of every EDC that exists in our planet today</strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">in turn, addressing leptin resistance and stopping food cravings.</span> </p>
    <p>While helping cleanse the kidneys and liver, and supporting a healthy heart, brain and joints.</p>
    <p>I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>Here were completely natural ingredients that had been scientifically proven to target the root-cause of belly fat,</strong></span> yet not a single doctor or the weight loss industry had ever told my wife anything about them.</p>
    <p>All they wanted to do was keep selling her expensive diet plans, exercise routines and medications.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">I was now more determined than ever to not only melt Grace’s body fat, but help millions of others too</span></p>
    <p>But I came across a big problem.</p>
    <p>It took me days to source all the ingredients from the recipe from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Thousands of dollars to buy them.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image039.jpg"></p>
    <p> Weeks to extract the potent seeds and leaves, one by one.</p>
    <p>Then dry them out, grind them down, and measure them into the right required ratio</p>
    <p>And by the time I was finished, I was exhausted and I barely had enough of the mixture to last a few days.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">I understood now why Ashraff was so protective of his plant mixture, and why he kept it under lock and key!</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>I needed a plan B.</strong></span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image040.jpg"></p>
    <p> I reasoned that if I bought the ingredients in bulk, and contacted a large, modern, and prestigious manufacturing facility in the USA that could do everything for me, <span class="highlightOp">I could produce this incredible craving crushing recipe in the quantity I needed and in tiny easy to swallow capsules as Grace requested…</span></p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image041.jpg"></p>
    <p> And while I was at it, take Ashraff’s ancient recipe, and improve it with modern science and technology. By doing that I would be able to create a formula <span style="color:red;"><strong>even more powerful than Ashraff’s</strong>, and give Grace a real shot at losing all her stubborn fat.</span></p>
    <p>But of course, without any medical training or experience, I needed help.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Sonya Rhodes, a dedicated independent medical researcher with over 29 years’ experience had a personal interest in what I was doing</span>.</p>
    <p>Her brother, husband, and even her 19-year-old son struggled with weight loss and were sick and tired of the failed diets and the health risks.</p>
    <p>Sonya was one of those rare people who exuded charisma, warmth and intelligence. When we first met, she greeted me with a warm hug and a big smile.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>“Your research is completely correct”, she said.</strong></span></p>
    <p>“We all know that skinny person that never seems to put on weight, well they aren’t special, they don’t have a secret… they’re just not leptin resistant yet…”</p>
    <p>“<span class="highlightOp">You see we are all affected by EDCs – endocrine disrupting chemicals - at different rates based on our body type… that’s why some people are hungrier and have a higher BMI more than others, and why you Morgan are only about 40 pounds overweight, but your wife is far more.”</span></p>
    <p>“In fact, women are affected by EDC induced leptin resistance worse than men.”</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>“The human body has not evolved to synthesize its own detoxifying nutrients to clear out this new threat, the EDCs… they’ve only been around for the past 70 years or so…”</strong></span></p>
    <p>“So, the only way to do this is with the incredible plants you’ve discovered”</p>
    <p>“I’d love to help” she said…</p>
    <p>So, Sonya took Ashraff’s recipe of 11 natural ingredients and tested hundreds of different formulas and gauged what happened to leptin resistance.</p>
    <p>It took 6 months of research but eventually Sonya found the perfect combination!</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>Plus, Sonya had found another 11 amazing nutrients that would boost the power of the recipe even further.</strong></span></p>
    <p>So you benefit not only from the detoxifiers: milk thistle, jujube seed, barberry, alfalfa, taraxacum leaves and 6 more as we’ve already mentioned…</p>
    <p> But newly discovered detoxifying ingredients like</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image041.jpg"></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>n-acetyl cysteine, burdock root, choline, chicory root, methionine, feverfew plus 5 more.</strong></span> </p>
    <p>That if taken alone would have little effect, but when formulated together and consumed once a day, <span class="highlightOp">would produce remarkable results!</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">In total 22 plant extracts and nutrients made this plant formula <span style="color:red;">TWICE as powerful </span> than the original recipe consumed by Ashraff and his family and friends!</span></p>
    <p>Sonya stated…</p>
    <p>“This new breakthrough addresses the one true cause of leptin resistance… endocrine disrupting chemicals.”</p>
    <p>“When you correct and target these toxins, <span class="highlightOp"><strong>you can naturally support your ability to feel full,</strong> and satisfied after eating, so you will no longer feel hungry, and will effortlessly drop pounds of fat, you’ll support a healthy heart and blood sugar as your leptin resistance and food consumption is addressed.”</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">Nothing like this had ever been attempted before in the history of weight loss, and <span class="highlightOp">I literally couldn’t wait to get started</span>.</span></p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image043.jpg" width="150"><img src="/i7/image044.jpg" width="200"></p>
    <p> And the best part was, because the proprietary blend is 100% natural and the facility where we produced our capsules is FDA registered and GMP certified, <strong>we didn’t have to wait for approval</strong>. </p>
    <p>We just needed one willing patient to put the protocol to the test.</p>
    <p>And of course, that patient – was Grace.</p>
    <p>It took every penny we had to produce a few weeks’ worth of our vegetable capsules for Grace to take once a day with a glass of water.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image045.jpg"></p>
    <p>Honestly, I could see how skeptical Grace was the first time I gave her a glass of water and the tiny plant-filled capsule. She looked at me like I was crazy.</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Still, I had to BEG her to keep taking them once a day… she thought it was just another waste of time…</strong></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">After 7 days she’d lost about 3lbs but we thought nothing of it…</span></p>
    <p>Until later that evening when something remarkable happened.</p>
    <p>We’d just finished dinner and I handed Grace the bowl to grab a second portion of food, a habit we’d gotten used to since she gained the weight.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;"><strong>“No, I’m fine thanks, I’m full”</strong></span><span class="highlightOp">she said.</span></p>
    <p>What!</p>
    <p>I hadn’t heard that in 10 years…</p>
    <p>We both looked at each other in shock, then burst out laughing.</p>
    <p>Remember belly fat is simply a symptom of leptin resistance… well since she had tackled her leptin resistance - her cravings vanished, <span class="highlightOp">and the weight started melting off her like butter in a microwave.</span></p>
    <p>And still she was eating cake, pizza, chocolate and all her favorite foods.</p>
    <p>She didn’t force herself to stop eating.</p>
    <p>She WANTED to.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style=" color:red;">She was full and satisfied <strong>after just a couple bites</strong> of her favorite delicious treats.</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">The way our bodies are naturally meant to function.</span> </p>
    <p>It was like a gastric band had been fitted…</p>
    <p>And each day following was like a dream.</p>
    <p>Every morning her weight dropped, 1lb, 2lbs, 2lbs, 1lbs…</p>
    <p>But the best was yet to come.</p>
    <p>Day 21 was a sunny Sunday morning, and I’ll remember it forever.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">I woke to the loudest scream I’ve ever heard.</span></p>
    <p>Scared, I instinctively reached for my handgun in the nightstand, until the screams turned to laughter.</p>
    <p>I ran to the bathroom, where I saw Grace standing on the scales, tears rolling down her face.</p>
    <p>But this time, they weren’t tears of guilt, of shame…</p>
    <p>They were tears of happiness – of joy.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>And soon enough, she was 62lbs lighter!</strong></span></p>
    <p>Going from this… </p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image003.jpg"></p>
    <p>to this slim and sexy lady I’m proud to call my wife today…</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image004.jpg"></p>
    <p>Every single trace of her pregnancy fat had disappeared!</p>
    <p>And every day she was safely shedding pure belly fat, arm fat, chin fat, her love handles disappeared…</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">She was so excited to show me her jeans falling off her hips in a way they hadn’t in 25 years…</span> </p>
    <p>Plus, she had so much more energy… she was sleeping better…</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image046.jpg"></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>She supported new healthy joints, and a pain free body.</strong></span></p>
    <p><strong>Even her hair <span style="color:red;">seemed thicker, fuller and shinier than it had…</span></strong></p>
    <p>Her fears of worsening health vanished…</p>
    <p>When we saw Doctor Mathews, he couldn’t believe his eyes. He was speechless that she had lost all that weight achieved it all by herself, naturally and safely and without any stress.</p>
    <p>That evening we threw all her diet food in the trash. What a great feeling!</p>
    <p>It was like a time machine taking us back 10 years before this nightmare began.</p>
    <p>But the most amazing thing was watching Grace’s stomach…</p>
    <p>Watching the belly fat she’d been fighting for years and years <span class="highlightOp">shrink away to nothing…</span></p>
    <p>Until one day I came home and saw her walking around the house in a sports bra and shorts, her beautiful flat belly on display.</p>
    <p>I was a little afraid to touch her at first… afraid she’d tell me not to…</p>
    <p>But when I wrapped my arms around her, she melted, tilted her head so I could kiss her neck, then smiled at me and told me to meet her in the bedroom.</p>
    <p>It was the most amazing, passionate night of my life.</p>
    <p>As we lay there naked, cuddling and laughing, in love again, in a way we hadn’t been for a long time, I had a huge smile across my face.</p>
    <p>I’d done it. I’d saved my wife.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Grace had broken free from the cycle of leptin resistance.</span></p>
    <p>She was back in control of her own hunger.</p>
    <p><strong>Neither of us could believe it.</strong></p>
    <p>I was desperate to get the formula out to as many people as possible, but Sonya warned me that one person wasn’t proof that it worked.</p>
    <p><strong>And she was right.</strong></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style=" color:red;">It may have worked for Grace, but would it work for everyone?</span></p>
    <p>I wanted to see if the formula would work on people who were suffering the most with uncontrolled hunger and weight gain.</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image047.jpg"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>I decided to post ads online and in local newspapers, asking for volunteers who might be willing to put our fat burning formula to the test.</strong></span></p>
    <p>They had to be: Over 40 years old, overweight and unable to lose weight no matter their diet or how much they exercised, tired, hungry and fed up.</p>
    <p>After just 10 days, we had 45 people, suffering from varying degrees of weight gain to put it to the test.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp"><strong>The results were way more incredible than any of us could ever have imagined.</strong></span></p>
    <p>Without exception, and within a just a few weeks, all 45 volunteers reported dramatic drops in their hunger and cravings, and in turn their weight.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>The average weight loss was 53lbs!</strong></span></p>
    <p>Energy levels soared...</p>
    <p>Dangerous visceral fat around organs vanished…</p>
    <p>Brain fog lifted…</p>
    <p>Aches and pains subsided…</p>
    <p>Stress disappeared…</p>
    <p>Sex drive returned and rocketed…</p>
    <p>They supported new healthy hearts, arteries and blood pressure…</p>
    <p>Many reported seeing their abs for the very first time in their lives!</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>A total of 97% of participants went on to lose over 59lbs of fat.</strong></span></p>
    <p>The other 3% lost over 40lbs, but were no less <span style="color:red;">overjoyed at the weight loss and health benefits they’d achieved.</span></p>
    <p>I received emails, phone calls and text messages from people overwhelmed</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">This was it – we’d done it.</span> </p>
    <p>We’d developed a natural, clinically proven treatment for addressing even the worst cases of uncontrolled belly fat.</p>
    <p>After seeing the effect that insatiable cravings and weight gain had on my own wife, <span class="highlightOp">I’ve made it my mission to ensure that no one else ever has to suffer like she did.</span></p>
    <p>This protocol works, and I’m excited to say that the obscene statistics about our weight are about to change forever.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Remember, due to the toxic environment we now live in, our cells are being relentlessly attacked by endocrine disrupting chemicals on a daily basis.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>This happens no matter where you live on earth. It is unavoidable.</strong></span></p>
    <p>As a result, they predict that nearly 75% of all American adults will be overweight by 2020.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>Today, things are finally about to change.</strong></span></p>
    <p>With Sonya Rhodes’ help, we’ve created a clinically proven and all-natural formula that will allow you to finally melt your belly fat… and take back control over your hunger and cravings.</p>
    <p>… With no medications, no exercises, no dieting, and you can start TODAY.</p>
    <p>And we’ve called it…</p>
    <p class="is-size-1"><span class="highlightOp">Leptitox</span></p>
    <p> The one and only all-natural proprietary blend that targets the true cause of your belly fat, leptin resistance.</p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image049.jpg" width="500"></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">We’ve sourced all the <span style="color:red;"><strong>purest, highest quality</strong></span> 22 natural detoxifying nutrients and plant extracts</span> that we’ve spoken about today and put the exact quantities into a small easy to swallow capsule to take once a day.</p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Every capsule is manufactured here in the USA in our FDA approved and GMP (good manufacturing practice) certified facility</strong></span> under the most sterile, strict, and precise standards.</p>
    <p>These capsules are non-GMO, safe, there are no dangerous stimulants or toxins, and they are not habit forming or tolerance forming.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span class="highlightOp">Losing weight with Leptitox is so easy to do, a child could…</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>Yet, it’s more powerful than any diet or exercise on the planet.</strong></span></p>
    <p>This formula is not only incredible for your weight, but helps support a healthy heart, brain and joints, boosts energy levels, and much more, so you’ll also be improving your overall health at the same time.</p>
    <p>And the best part is, there’s no need to completely change your diet, or starve yourself!</p>
    <p>Here we are, ready for YOU to finally get the flat belly and slim body you’ve been dreaming of and which you deserve…</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">166,304 people have already transformed their waist size, energy, and lives with Leptitox.</span> Take it now and achieve the same dramatic improvements in your hunger and weight that Grace and they did.</p>
    <p>It really is that simple.</p>
    <p>And you can get access to everything in the next 90 seconds.</p>
    <p>So, if you're ready for something big, something new, something exciting, then it starts right here by you taking a stand and saying, yes, I'm ready for the change that Leptitox can bring into my life.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;">You need to ask yourself this:</span></p>
    <p>How much is it worth to you to have your friends JEALOUS of the amazing changes you’ve made to your body …begging you for your secrets…?</p>
    <p>How much is it worth to NEVER feel like you have to “deprive” yourself of your favorite foods?</p>
    <p>Or to burden your family with worry about your health?</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>To be back in FULL CONTROL over your hunger</strong></span></p>
    <p>Imagine that for a second…</p>
    <p>Really let yourself feel what that would be like…</p>
    <p>And then tell me…</p>
    <p>How much would that be worth?</p>
    <p>$10,000?</p>
    <p>$5,000?</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;">There’s one undeniable fact I’ve learned again and again…</span></p>
    <p>That even when you want something so much and KNOW it’s a once-in-a-lifetime deal…</p>
    <p>As a man or woman who’s spent so much of your life GIVING and GIVING to others…</p>
    <p>Sometimes it feels impossible to be “selfish” and give yourself what you so desperately need…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>Which is why I’m going to do something kind of risky here</strong></span></p>
    <p> And although Sonya Rhodes recommended, I sell a 30-day supply of Leptitox for $997…</p>
    <p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/i7/image049.jpg"></p>
    <p>And my own wife Grace suggested $597…</p>
    <p>And although it’s already helped over 166,304 men and women who would happily pay triple that amount after seeing the results for themselves…</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">This isn’t about the money for me.</span> </p>
    <p>I know what it feels like to watch someone you love lose their health. I know the fear, pain and helplessness of watching your loved one pile on more and more fat and not being able to do anything to help them. I don’t want this for you. I feel blessed to have found this amazing formula and now I want to share it with you.</p>
    <p>So, I’m not going to ask for $597…</p>
    <p>Or half of that…</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Because the truth is, all I’m trying to do here is cover my costs and keep this website running for as long as I can</span>, so as many people as possible can benefit.</p>
    <p>The last thing I want is for price to be a factor in your decision.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="">So even though I will <strong>soon</strong> charge $99 for a bottle of Leptitox.</span></p>
    <p>And for most of our customers we've heard from, we saw that a $99 bottle replaces over $300 a month in food you won't be eating anymore, and/or medication you may not have to take.</p>
    <p>You are here, watching this presentation, and showing me your trust and since you want the absolute best for yourself, and to live the healthiest life possible…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp"><strong>You can get a 30-day supply of Leptitox for a simple one-time fee of just $69. &nbsp;<span style="color:red;">Yes just $69.</span></strong></span></p>
    <p>But before you order, as you've seen in the studies today, the doctors and Sonya Rhodes who have researched these natural ingredients recommend you take Leptitox <span class="highlightOp">for at least 90 days to ensure you reach your desired weight.</span></p>
    <p>That's because if you are over 40 years old and more than 10lbs over weight, <span style="color:red;"><strong>Leptitox needs enough time to work throughout your entire body</strong> to get you back into balance and capable of losing weight.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>So, to guarantee life-changing results, we’re going to let you order 3 bottles or 6 bottles at once for a huge saving</strong></span></p>
    <p>and if you do that in the next 30 minutes, <span class="highlightOp">you’ll also get a special FREE bonus - which is the final piece of the puzzle.</span> </p>
    <p><span style=" color:red;"><strong>It’s called Leptitox Colon Cleanse</strong></span></p>
    <p><img src="/i7/image94.jpg" width="500"></p>
    <p>Why detoxify your body and not detoxify the overlooked organ that is responsible for your nutrient absorption, energy levels, concentration and restroom regularity!</p>
    <p>I couldn’t let you order without having every tool you need to feel great and healthy. <span class="highlightOp">And that includes your ability to absorb all the special Leptitox nutrients.</span></p>
    <p>With this once a day oral supplement <span style="color:red;"><strong>containing a proprietary blend of 10 100% natural ingredients designed to support a healthy colon</strong>, such as psyllium husks, bentonite clay, black walnut hull and apple pectin</span></p>
    <p>You will ensure your colon is detoxed, clean, healthy, and functional – allowing your body to increase absorption of all the amazing nutrients of Leptitox, as well as boosting energy, concentration, and of course giving you regular and healthy restroom breaks. </p>

    <p>And then see for yourself how EASY getting a taut, firm, FLAT belly and watching the pounds FALL off your body can actually be…</p>
    <p>How EASY it is to target leptin resistance, to TAKE BACK CONTROL over your hunger and feel electric with new found energy…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span class="highlightOp">And remember your order is 100% protected by my 60-day money back guarantee.</span> </p>
    <p>OK, it’s time to take action…</p>
    <p>You might not know it but you’re at an important crossroads in your life right now…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>And you really just have two options…</strong></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>Leading to two very different lives…</strong></span></p>
    <p>One, a lifetime of energy and hope and passion for life, where you LOVE your body and are amazed every time you look in the mirror…</p>
    <p>Where you are no longer shackled to diets, to exercise programs, to the fear of further complications…</p>
    <p>The other…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>Well, the other is just a continuation of the life you have now…</strong></span></p>
    <p>So, listen closely as I tell you what your two options are so you can make the right choice for you…</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">OPTION #1: You can choose to do exactly what the mainstream ‘healthcare’ system want you to do</span>, and carry on dieting, exercising, and maybe losing some weight, but having it all come back on and more…</p>
    <p>Remember, by doing this you’ll never be free to eat what you want…</p>
    <p>You’ll never escape the cycle of dieting and exercise - which was never designed to keep weight loss off for life. It was designed to keep you trapped in the yo-yo effect until the day you die…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="">That’s the way the weight loss industry system works.</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">It locks you into a lifetime of meal plans and expensive fads…</span> </p>
    <p>I think you already know what will happen if you do take this option because you’ve felt it so many times before…</p>
    <p>That feeling of hopelessness…</p>
    <p>Of being trapped in your body…</p>
    <p>Of feeling yourself getting heavier and more exhausted and more FED UP with your struggle with your weight and with your body every single day…</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=" color:red;"><strong>Wondering why it’s SO HARD for you to get in shape and STAY in shape…</strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Or feeling GUILTY because you aren’t spending HOURS and HOURS at the gym every week pedaling as fast as you can but not getting anywhere at all…</span> </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>I know you don’t want that…</strong></span></p>
    <p>And remember, the average American will spend $111,500 in their attempt to lose weight over their lifetime…</p>
    <p>That’s the financial cost of doing nothing.</p>
    <p>The human cost is far greater.</p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style="">Is that really a risk you want to take to save a few dollars?</span></p>
    <p>Truth is, I know you are SICK of seeing your ugly belly fat staring at you every time you look in the mirror…</p>
    <p>Of pretending it doesn’t bother you and that you’re “OK” with the body you have right now…</p>
    <p>Of YEARNING to know what it’s like to have power and control and ENERGY like you did when you were a kid…</p>
    <p>Which is why I want you to take a second here and seriously consider taking:</p>
    <p class="is-size-1"><span style="color:red;">OPTION #2…</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">And let’s face it, it’s the only option you have.</span> </p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp" style="color:red;"><strong>Investing in a one-time payment in Leptitox today, so you can put my formula to the test,</strong></span><span class="highlightOp">completely risk-free for a full 60 days…</span> </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-2 is-size-3-touch"><span style=""><strong>And just imagine the difference this could make to your life…</strong></span></p>
    <p>NO MORE fear over worsening health…</p>
    <p>NO MORE feeling guilt or shame over ANOTHER failed diet or exercise plan</p>
    <p>NO MORE worrying about what you eat, or what others think of what you eat</p>
    <p>NO MORE feeling heavy and feeling disgust at how you look in the mirror or what your partner thinks about you</p>
    <p>NO MORE counting calories or tracking food…</p>
    <p>In a lot of ways<span style="color:red;"><strong>, it’s the easier road because all it takes on your part is deciding you love yourself enough to say “Yes” right now…</strong></span></p>

    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Hey, still here?</strong></span></p>
    <p>Great. I wanted to take a second to answer some of the most common questions I get about Leptitox. Because I want to make sure that you feel confident and comfortable with your decision to order today. </p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>So, number one is, is Leptitox right for me?</strong></span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>I get this question a lot, and the answer is always the same…</strong></span></p>
    <p>Do you have stored body fat that you have tried to get rid of in the past but nothing's worked? Because if that's you, then Leptitox is absolutely the right choice. As we talked about earlier, the real problem with not being able to lose body fat is that worldwide endocrine disrupting chemicals are forcing your brain to ignore leptin – the “full” hormone - and thus you are not feeling full when you are supposed to. Leptitox will help you with that.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>Is Leptitox safe?</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>Leptitox has been taken by thousands of folks with no reported side effects</strong></span>. The only side effect is having to spend money on new tight-fitting sexy clothing, or cancel your gym membership.</p>
    <p>And Leptitox is a lot safer than starvation diets or hours of high intensity cardio at the gym, because you are restoring your body’s natural leptin and hunger response rather than disrupting it further. Addressing leptin resistance is the single most important thing you can do right now for long-lasting results now and into old age.</p>
    <p>Leptitox is safer than your daily multivitamin. It has natural ingredients and they're extremely high quality, manufactured at an FDA-inspected, state-of-the-art facility, using the latest equipment and then on top of that they're put through additional third-party inspections and quality control so you can rest assured that Leptitox is safe. </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>And, as always, if you currently have a medical condition or you're taking other prescription medication, I advise you to show a bottle of this to your doctor before you take it, just to be safe.</strong></span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>When should I take Leptitox?</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
    <p><span style="color:red;"><strong>For best results, take two capsules with a big glass of water in the afternoon for additional energy and weight loss support. </strong></span> Leptitox is going to work with your body to naturally adjust you back into a healthy rhythm, and it's going to leave you energized, well-rested, and just overall enjoying life again.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>What if it doesn't work for me, can you tell me more about the guarantee?</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>I'm confident that Leptitox will give you the powerful support you need to target leptin resistance, but I also know that no two people's bodies work the exact same way. So, a small number of people might find it doesn't give them all of the benefits they were looking for. <span style="color:red;"><strong>And that's why every single bottle of Leptitox comes with my personal 60-day 100% money back guarantee.</strong> If for any reason you're unsatisfied with your results, you can just return what you haven't used for a full, no questions asked refund.</span></p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp"><strong>What if I lose weight too fast?</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
    <p>This is actually a really interesting question that I get asked sometimes. The results that we've highlighted today are incredible, and if you do lose weight too fast, I would suggest taking Leptitox every second day rather than every day, and always consult with your doctor. Leptitox is an extremely powerful remedy.</p>
    <p><span class="highlightOp">Even with that in mind, we always want to advise you to lose weight at a healthy, steady pace</span>. </p>
    <p>Now, I know it can be exciting to see results that you've been wanting for so long, and then you want to push yourself harder. </p>
    <p>But it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle in addition to taking Leptitox, and that way you're going to get the best long-term results. </p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style="color:red;"><strong>So, I'm really looking forward to hearing your success story and I want to thank you for sticking around and hearing about this incredible new tool in your weight loss journey.</strong></span></p>
    <p>I hope I've answered any of your remaining questions, and by this time, I hope I've given you the confidence to order your own supply of Leptitox today. You can go ahead and do that by just choosing your package below and completing your Leptitox order now. Remember shipping is 100% free. </p>
    <p>And also, I do want to say I personally recommend our <strong>most popular 3 or 6 bottle package</strong> for the best value - and those come with one or two <span class="highlightOp">FREE bottles of our proprietary formula Leptitox Colon Cleanse.</span></p>
    <p class="subtitle is-size-3 is-size-4-touch"><span style=""><strong>So just go ahead and click the button below, complete your checkout, and I'll be talking to you soon.</strong></span></p>
